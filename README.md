[`C++ OpenGL 3D Game Tutorial Series`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8DnRaQOs5-TyYnF56YghOxQBNr1VVmF) is a YouTube Tutorial Series,</br>
whose purpose is to help all those who want to take their first steps in the game development from scratch.</br>
In this series you'll learn how to create a Cross-Platform OpenGL 3D Game in C++ from scratch, starting from the creation of a Window by using Win32, Cocoa and X11 APIs (Windows, macOS and Linux respectively)</br>
to the making of all the necessary sub-systems in order to achieve a complete 3D Game, like</br>

- OpenGL 3D Graphics Engine</br>
 Vertex Array Object (VAO)</br>
 Shaders</br>
 Uniform Buffer Object (UBO)</br>
 ...</br>
- Entity System</br>
- Input System</br>
- ...</br>
